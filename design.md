        I got my foot in the door of the tech industry as a designer for a large print shop in a small town. We did everything from t-shirts to large-format vehicle wraps. They showed me the ropes with Photoshop, Illustrator, and Quark and I could do the occasional web work. The time I spent as a freelancer, I had to wear the designer hat as well as the developer's.
