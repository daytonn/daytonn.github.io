        I got my foot in the door of the tech industry as a designer for a large print shop in a small town. We did everything from t-shirts to large-format vehicle wraps. They showed me the ropes with Photoshop, Illustrator, and Quark and I did the occasional web work. I also wore the designer hat when I was freelancing.
