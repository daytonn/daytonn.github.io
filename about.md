Hello, my name is Dayton and I'm a web developer from Chicago. I've been writing software for over a decade. I started with front-end development, teaching myself how to make simple websites. I continued my learning on the server-side, to become a full-stack developer.

I've worked for product companies, run my own business, worked as a freelancer, and worked in consulting.  I enjoy writing libraries and applications in a variety of languages including JavaScript, Ruby, and Elixir.

I'm most fluent in JavaScript. It's one of the first languages I learned. Over the last 5 years I've been working with Ruby on Rails, with various flavors of client-side frameworks.
