I tend to write a lot of developer productivity tools and small JavaScript libraries. Bash scripting and small command line utilities are a hobby of mine. I also have a few pet JavaScript libraries. I've got a small handful of Ruby gems with a sprinkling of SublimeText plugins and themes.

Here are a few of my favorites

### Baptize

Baptize is a light-weight, pure bash tool for customizing your bash environment.

### Rails JSKit

Rails JSKit is a simple javascript event system for a rails application. It allows you to write testable javascript for your controllers without tight coupling to your Rails app.

### JSKit

JSKit is a small event system that can be plugged into back-ends like Ruby on Rails to coordinate front-end scripting with application routing.

### EnhancedReadline

EnhancedReadline is a Sublime Text package that fixes some default <a href="https://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html" target="_blank">readline</a> keybindings that are not bound by Sublime. It also adds some readline-style keybindings for Sublime line editing features.
